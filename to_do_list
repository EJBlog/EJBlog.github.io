•	Coding/changes for Site (Prioritized highest to lowest):
 
1.	Change all content (categories, text, images) (In Progress)
             Might still need to update category images and quotes
    ii.	Update “view all posts by Author” link in authors pages
        1.	New page to display all author posts

      i.	Don’t forget header and footers - DONE
      ii.	Change photos for Category squares - Still need to do the IT square
      iii.	About page header (DONE - takes longer to load)
4.	Add pages to display posts written by guests (In Progress)
  a.	Each guest author gets their own? Need to do the same as Evan and Jake posts (possibly a “see more” link)
  b.  Add author_image_file variable to YAML file in _data repo so guest author page displays their image (blah.jpg) (DONE)
      - Have to manually upload their post and image, then add their author info to the YAML file in _data
      - Should we choose similar posts ourselves or not include them on guest posts?
5.	Favorites page?

10. Secure the site with something like cloudflare

Changes needed after testing:
- Add similar posts to more existing posts (EVAN & JAKE)
- Spacing/margins between posts and on sidebar text (JAKE)
- Add search bar to view all posts (EVAN)
- Discuss categories page (EVAN & JAKE)
- Change IT image for category thumbnail and page sidebar
- Change Miscellaneous image for page sidebar
- Change Guest Authors image for page sidebar

- Remove black bar at the top of page on About.html and Contact.html
  - Notes: Contact.html, About.html, and Category.html are only three pages showing black bar and
    only three pages not working on Google Analytics (nothing being tracked). Tried many things to
    fix this issue. They also happen to be the only three files that don't have a linked file within
    the _layouts folder... I think this has to be causing Analytics to fail for some reason and creating
    a random black bar. Have to do more research. -Evan
