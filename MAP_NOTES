Requirements:
Upload pictures onto the site
Edit, Crop, filter images on our site
Fit images to the shape of state(s) of the user's choice
Allow users to choose from preexsting maps or load their own
Export Individual state images or entire country projects
Save states and/or country projects

Long term goals:
Start printing/ cutting states or images into wood
Maybe work with small business for printing - we create the map of images and partner with Etsy or small businesses for printing
User can upload any image and we will use the outline of that image to fit a picture of the user's choice into it.
