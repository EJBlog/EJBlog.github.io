Short term goals:
Be able to click on a state and move to the editor page for that particular state
Get editor to change size and shape to specific states - start with Kentucky
Be able to resize and move an image to fit inside the state size and shape
be able to load an image from our local drive

Long term goals:
Start printing/ cutting states or images into wood
Maybe work with small business for printing - we create the map of images and partner with Etsy or small businesses for printing
User can upload any image and we will use the outline of that image to fit a picture of the user's choice into it.
