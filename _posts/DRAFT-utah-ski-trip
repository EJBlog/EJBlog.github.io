I am writing this post a little late since the trip to Utah was over a month ago. With that being said, I wish I could go back to last month and do it all over again. <!--endpreview--> Even with the flight troubles I had on the first day (February, 27th) I am extremely happy I spent the extra month and made it to Salt Lake City. You can read all about those flight issues in this <a src="{{site.url}}/_posts/2016-02-27-flight-troubles.md">post</a>

I am a little frustrated while writing this because I was hoping to have all of the video footage edited into a beautiful video by now, although my 2008 Macbook has decided it is too difficult to process video files. It takes hours just to load the footage to iMovie and then the software cannot be updated so that means I cannot do simple things like slow motion or fast forward. I guess the pictures will have to do until I purchase a new laptop and finish the video.
