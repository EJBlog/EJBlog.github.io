I am writing this post a little late since the trip to Utah was over a month ago. With that being said, I wish I could go back to last month and do it all over again. <!--endpreview--> Even with the flight troubles I had on the first day (February, 27th) I am extremely happy I spent the extra money and made it to Salt Lake City. You can read all about those flight issues in this <a href="http://www.officetoadventure.com/2016/02/27/flight-troubles.html">post</a>.

First, lets start with a caveat. I am a little frustrated while writing this because I was hoping to have all of the video footage edited into a beautiful video by now, although my 2008 Macbook has decided it is too difficult to process video files. It takes hours just to load the footage to iMovie and then the software cannot be updated so that means I cannot do simple things like slow motion or fast forward. I hope the pictures will do until I purchase a new laptop and finish the video. Now I digress..

This ski trip was the first time most of us had enjoyed the snow of the west and I have to say I already want to go back. At first glance, I was amazed at how easy it was to get from the SLC airport to the resort. A short forty minute drive up to Solitude mountain while passing signs for other big name resorts such as Snowbird and Alta. After stopping to get groceries, we found our the condo well after the sun had gone down. Needless to say, we were eager to see the morning sun reflecting off the long awaited mountain.

When the morning came, we woke up before our alarms and were ready to go before the lifts even opened. Looking up from the top we were amazed. Larger than anything we have near Kentucky and we couldn't even see the highest peak yet.

Flying versus driving

Finding cheap flights, rental cars, and hotels.
