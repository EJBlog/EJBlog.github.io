I am writing this post a little late since the trip to Utah was over a month ago. With that being said, I wish I could go back to last month and do it all over again. <!--endpreview--> Even with the flight troubles I had on the first day (February, 27th) I am extremely happy I spent the extra money and made it to Salt Lake City. You can read all about those flight issues in this <a href="http://www.officetoadventure.com/2016/02/27/flight-troubles.html">post</a>.

Lets start with a caveat. I am a little frustrated while writing this because I was hoping to have all of the video footage edited into a beautiful video by now, although my 2008 Macbook has decided it is too old to process video files. I hope the pictures will do until I purchase a new laptop and finish the video. Now I digress..

First, lets talk about the challenges of flying with ski gear for the first time. Depending on which airline you fly with this could be easy or difficult. You have to check at least your ski/board bag so I recommend going with an airline that gives you free checked bags. Also, stuff your ski/board bag with as much gear as possible. We went with a double ski bag and stuffed it to the brim. It was not a high end bag and by the end of the trip we could see some wear and tear. So if you are planning to take multiple trips a year with this bag I recommend getting a name brand for a few extra dollars. The more expensive bags will come with padding and will be made with stronger materials. Lastly, carry your boots as a personal item and stuff them with snacks, charger cords, and whatever else you need on the flights. They can get a little annoying when trying to put them in the overhead bin, although it saves space in your checked bag and is free on every airline.

This ski trip was the first time most of us had enjoyed the snow of the west and I have to say I already want to go back. At first glance, I was amazed at how easy it was to get from the SLC airport to the resort. A short forty minute drive up to Solitude mountain while passing signs for other big name resorts such as Snowbird and Alta. After stopping to get groceries, we found our the condo well after the sun had gone down. Needless to say, we were eager to see the morning sun reflecting off the long awaited mountain.

When the morning came, we woke up before our alarms and were ready to go before the lifts even opened. Looking from the base, up to the top, we were amazed. Larger than anything we have near Kentucky and we couldn't even see the highest peak yet. After spending the entire day on the mountain I think we had decided we could easily do this every day. Each run was different and you could literally go anywhere you wanted. One of the most amazing aspects of the mountain was that it was all natural snow. In Kentucky it is all fake snow.

My favorite runs were anything off of the Summit Express lift, especially near the Honeycomb Canyon. The traverse underneath Fantasty ridge was unlike anything I've ever skied before. Keeping up the momentum to make it through valleys and over ridges made it difficult and the views were amazing. We tried to make it the entire traverse, although we were stopped by signs saying "Avalanche Area". As much as we wanted to continue on, we didnt have the knowledge or gear to explore in avalanche terrain. So we would drop into the canyon wherever we wanted and would meet back at the bottom of the lift.
