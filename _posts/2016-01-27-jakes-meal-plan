<p>I enjoy going to gym and playing sports because it allows me to relieve stress and get my mind off the obligitory stresses of the world. But dont get me wrong, I also want to become bigger, faster, and stronger. 
In order to do that I realized <!--endpreview--> I need to eat a lot more... Like a whole lot more.</p>

<p>

I have been going to the gym consistantly for about 3 years now and by no means do I consider myself "big", although I feel much stronger than when I started. 
When I say "consistantly", I mean going to the gym an average of no less than three days a week doing heavy lifting. during those weeks I often played some type of sport (basketball, softball, rock climbing, etc) once or twice a week.
When I started going to the gym I weighed about 170lbs and was lifting a respectable amount but all of my major lifts were under my body weight. 
Now, after three years weigh about 185lbs I am happy to say I can deadlift, squat, and benchpress well past my body weight. 
Some people may say "why did it take you so long?" or "three years is a long time" and I say that is fine. 
I am not training to be a body builder or a model or anything other than a strong and healthier me.
