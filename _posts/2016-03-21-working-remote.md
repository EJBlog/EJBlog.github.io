March 14, 2016 was the first day of working remote in Phoenix, AZ. Needless to say it has been a change from working in an office in Louisville, KY. Working remotely provides its own set of pros and cons, and after a week I have learned a lot. <!--endpreview-->
</p>

<p>
Originally, I thought the person that chose to work remotely/at-home full time was the same person who has young kids and no way to get them to daycare. I can see how people could take advantage of this benefit by watching TV or managing their own personal tasks rather than the work assigned by their employer. Lets be honest here, it's easy to throw in a load of laundry while muted on a conference call. Maybe that's why Yahoo!'s CEO, Marissa Mayer, disagrees with telecommuting. In the last seven days, my opinion of working remotely has changed. 
</p>

<p>
We arrived in Phoenix, AZ on March 11th, 2016, which gave us some time to get settled in. We set up the wifi, unpacked our bags and before we knew it the work week had begun. I quickly learned that Working in a place where your personal life collides with your professional life will inevitably create conflicts. I knew that in order to be successful I must must be persistent, have the ability to prioritize tasks, be self-motivated and self aware. This relates to personally as well as professionally. 
</p>

<p>
There are countless benefits to working remotely, but each decision must be made with the mindset of knowing how much is too much. 
</p>

<p>
So here is my list of pros:
<ul>

  <li>
  Saving money on gas and parking.
  </li>
  <li>
  No morning commute means more time to sleep.
  </li>
  <li>
  Traveling the United States while being financially stable.
  </li>
  <li>
  Rock climbing and other sports experienced all over the United States.
  </li>
  <li>
  Working 5am to 2pm in Phoenix (in order to match up with the Louisville office) gives Rachael, Boone, and I the entire evening to explore the area and plan out new adventures. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Choosing the weather we want to be in for the next few months.
  </li>
  <li>
  Being able keep my job rather than searching for a new one.
  </li>
  <li>
  Proving to myself and others that I am responsible enough to work remotely.
  </li>
  <li>
  Learning to maintain long distance relationships (professionally and personally).
  </li>
  
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I could go on for days about all of the positives, although there are always negatives associated with this as well. 
</p>

<p>
Here is my list of cons:

<ul>

<li>
Starting each workday at 5am means I am very tired by 7pm or 8pm each evening. 
</li>
<li>
Missing family and friends back in Kentucky.
</li>
<li>
Not being able to plan more than a few months ahead due to the fact that we don't know where we will be.
</li>
<li>
Pressures of being at home.
  <ul>
      <li>
      Traveling to new areas of the world is exciting, although there is self inflicted pressure to make work my second priority so that we can find the adventures awaiting in this new place. 
      </li>
      <li>
      Being at home with dog is great, although when I feel a toy at my feet I know she wants me to get up and play.   
      </li>
      <li>
      The couch. (not so much the TV since we have made the conscience decision to not get cable)
      </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</p>

<p>
In just the first week of working remote I have learned to be more conscience of my work as well as my time. It would be easy to take an "extended lunch break" to watch a new season on Netflix or go for a hike. The reason I choose not to do those things is because I know my work is my most important priority. If I did not make work my top priority then none of the things on my "pros" list would be possible.
