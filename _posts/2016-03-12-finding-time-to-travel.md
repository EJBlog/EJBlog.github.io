The ability to travel is a blessing. I am thankful for it and take advantage of the opportunity every chance I get. But I hear so many excuses from friends saying they can’t travel because (insert crap here).<!--endpreview-->

I began earning legitimate pay at the end of my sophomore year when I began an internship working as a Facilities Engineer. I had more money than I knew what to do with, but that lasted 2 weeks. I was buying clothes, tv’s, surround sound, shotguns, and more. A bunch of crap that gave me a short-lived buzz of excitement, but dwindled exponentially over time. The best thing I ever spent money on? Travel.

During that same internship, two of my friends (Rachel and Regina) were studying abroad in Florence, Italy. I had a birthday coming up, my 21st, and it just so happens that I was born in Italy (long story short: Dad in the Air Force). So what better way to celebrate than returning to my homeland? I had a floor to shack on and tour guides, so I asked my best friend (Matt) to 
accompany me and boom - the plan was in motion. It turned out to be the first trip I funded by myself (and Matt’s blackjack winnings) and it is the only purchase I remember/still enjoy from those paychecks.

I have digressed a little, but the main point of this post is to throw away all excuses for traveling. The biggest being money. If you take time to stop and budget you will find that the sacrifices made for the sake of travel are soon forgotten. Once you have the funds, there’s nothing to it but to do it. Plan ahead. Months ahead. Put your trip on the calendar and let the anticipation push you to save even more. If you truly have the desire to travel, don’t sell yourself short.

Money can be earned, saved, and spent any way you want. Time on the other hand cannot be earned or saved, but it can be wasted.
