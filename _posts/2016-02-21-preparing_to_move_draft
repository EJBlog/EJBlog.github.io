Rachael and I will be moving from Louisville, Ky to Phoenix, AZ. 
Rachael has accepted a 3 month (minimum) travel nursing assignment at the John C. Memorial hopsital and I will be working as a remote employee 
for my current employer, Humana Inc.  <!-- endpreview-->

We have always enjoyed traveling and knew that this was the best option in order travel while being financially stable.
Right now we are in the planning process, although our timeframe is very short. Rachael was offered her position on Tuesday February 16th
and accepted on Thursday February 18th. The hospital wanted her to begin working on March 14th which, gave us roughly a month to 
pack up everything we own, find a place to live in Phoenix, and drive out there. Needless to say it has been stressful. 

I beleive, the hardest part of it all is leaving our friends and family. Even though no one is suprised we are doing something adventurous like this,
it is hard to leave knowing we will miss so much. We will miss seeing our youngest nephew's first steps, another nephew's first soccer 
game, a sister playing on a D1 soccer soccer team, and all of the quality time spent with family and friends.

Our philosophy on life is that we all only have one (not to be confused with YOLO) and we need to be adventurous. Fortunately, we live
in a world filled with technologies that allow us to communicate at a very personal level. So we can use Facetime and Snapchat to be a part
of those special days while enjoying the experiences of traveling across the country (and maybe the world).
