<p>
Rachael and I will be moving from Louisville, Ky to Phoenix, AZ. 
Rachael has accepted a travel nursing assignment at the John C. Memorial hopsital and I will be working as a remote employee 
for my current employer, Humana Inc.  <!-- endpreview-->

We have always enjoyed traveling and knew that this was the best option in order travel while being financially stable.
Right now we are in the planning process, although our timeframe is very short. Rachael was offered her position on Tuesday February 16th
and accepted on Thursday February 18th. The hospital wanted her to begin working on March 14th which gave us roughly a month to 
pack up everything we own, find a place to live in Phoenix, and drive out there. Needless to say it has been stressful.
