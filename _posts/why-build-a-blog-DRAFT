<p>
With sites like Wordpress, Weebly, Squarespace, and Wix it is easier than ever to create your own blog or website. In fact, thousands of new blogs and websites are built each month. So why should you build your own? <!--endpreview--> Here are my ten reasons to start your own.
</p>

<p>

<ol>
<li>Work on your writing skills</li>
<li>Work on your technical skills</li>
<li>Have something to talk about (socially)</li>
<li>Have something to talk about (professionally)</li>
<li>Create time to think</li>
<li>Put yourself out there. Get out of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Incentivize/give purpose to your daily activities - doing things note worthy to have something to write about rather than the easy way</li>
<li>Dont take life too seriously - Have fun with it every now and then</li>
<li>because what do you have thats a better time waster? Watch youtube videos? Scroll through social media?</li>
<li>Get together with a buddy for a fun side project</li>
</ol>
