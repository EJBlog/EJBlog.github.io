With sites like Wordpress, Weebly, Squarespace, and Wix it is easier than ever to create your own blog or website. In fact, thousands of new blogs and websites are built each month. So why should you build your own? <!--endpreview--> Here are my five reasons to start your own.
</p>

<p>
<strong>One - Improve your writing skills:</strong> because you probably haven't actually written anything other than an email since you finished your last English course. At least way you get to choose what to write about.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Two - Work on your technical skills:</strong> To day's world revolves around technology and unfortunately using Instagram or Facebook does not necessarily make you tech savvy. Whether its setting up a WordPress site or building your own using Jekyll and google pages (like we did) it will provide more insite on the way most websites and applications are built.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Three - Have something to talk about (socially):</strong> I hope you're not still talking about high school sports or college parties anymore. Even if no one reads what you write, having something to write about means you are at least slightly knowledgable it. For me, having this site has forced me to read up on current events and learn new things which provides something to talk about when we go out with friends or meet new people. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Four = Have something to talk about (professionally):</strong> 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Five - Create time to think</strong>
</p>


<li>Put yourself out there. Get out of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Incentivize/give purpose to your daily activities - doing things note worthy to have something to write about rather than the easy way</li>
<li>Dont take life too seriously - Have fun with it every now and then</li>
<li>because what do you have thats a better time waster? Watch youtube videos? Scroll through social media?</li>
<li>Get together with a buddy for a fun side project</li>
</ol>
