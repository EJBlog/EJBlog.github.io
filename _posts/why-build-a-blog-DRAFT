With sites like Wordpress, Weebly, Squarespace, and Wix it is easier than ever to create your own blog or website. In fact, thousands of new blogs and websites are built each month. So why should you build your own? <!--endpreview--> Here are my five reasons to start your own.
</p>

<p>
<strong>One - Improve your writing skills:</strong> because you probably haven't actually written anything other than an email since you finished your last English course. At least way you get to choose what to write about. Also, what is a better way to critique your writing than putting it on the Internet for anyone to see? 
</p>


<p>
<strong>Two - Work on your technical skills:</strong> Today's world revolves around technology and unfortunately using Instagram or Facebook does not necessarily make you tech savvy. Whether it's setting up a WordPress site or building your own using Jekyll and google pages (like we did) it will provide more insite on the way most websites and applications are built.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Three - Have something to talk about (socially):</strong> I hope you're not still talking about high school sports or college parties anymore. Even if no one reads what you write, having something to write about means you are at least slightly knowledgeable  about it. For me, having this site has forced me to read up on current events and learn new things, which provides something to talk about when we go out with friends or meet new people. Plus talking to people is better than watching YouTube videos or scrolling through social media.

<strong>Four - Have something to talk about (professionally):</strong> As much as we all would like to believe that our current job is the last job interview we will ever have to go through, statistics show that's probably not the case. It's always good to say you are working on a side project within the realm of your professional career. A website or blog discussing topics related to your profession shows employers your are devoted to your trade and may give you a leg up when interviews or promotions come around.
</p>

<strong>Five - Create time to think:</strong> Maintaining a website or blog provides some incentive to do things with purpose rather than just watching Netflix and scrolling through Facebook. It provides a reason to think about thinks differently and to yearn for a deeper understanding. Also, it provides a good reason to get together with a friend and brainstorm on ideas.
