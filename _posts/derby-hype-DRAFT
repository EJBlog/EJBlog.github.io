First off, happy Cinco De Mayo!! The holiday that many believe is to celebrate the Mexican's Independence Day, although the fifth of May is actually celebrated as the day the Mexican Army overtook the French Army in the Battle of Puebla in 1852. Thanks, Google.

If you're not into drinking margaritas then don't worry. The first week of May also brings a different reason to celebrate; at least if you live in Kentucky or love horse racing. The first weekend in May is always home to the infamous Kentucky Derby horse race. Yes the races span just a Friday and Saturday, although the celebrations last an entire week. Many may wonder why there is such a hype over one of the fastest events in sports. Well here is why. 
</p>

<p>
In case you didn't know, Kentucky is home to hundreds of horse farms due to the rolling hills and blue grass. These farms often raise and train the most amazing horses to ever run really fast in a circle. Even after a horse's racing career is over, they may find themselves at a retirement farm known as a "stud" farm. As a Stud, these male horse are to spend the rest of their lives (you guessed it) making very strong and fast horse babies.

With all of the traditions and love for horses in the state (and surrounding states) there is no suprise why many would get excited about one of the largest horses races of the year. But for the locals there is more to it. The week leading up to the Oaks and Derby races is filled with events such as the Pegasis Parade, Chow Wagon, getting off work early, drinking bourbon, gambling, and of course Thurby. I promise I haven't been drinking bourbon and everything I just said is real. 
</p>

<p>
The Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville kicks off the Derby season with the running of the Derby mini and full marathon on the last weekend in April. Technically the Kentucky Derby Festival starts about a week earlier at the Thunder Over Louisville fireworks and airshow, although I don't really get in the Derby mindset until the Marathon since that is the signal we are only a week away from race day. From the end of the marathon until the final race at Churchill Downs there is always something to do in Louisville.
</p>

<p>
The Chow Wagon is essentially a county fair in downtown Louisville. There are trailers and booths selling deep fried everything, beer, bourbon slushies, helicopter rides over the city, kids rides, and live music. The best part is all of this within walking distance from any building downtown or a short drive from the Universiy of Louisville as well as Churchill downs. The Chow Wagon runs from the end of April until the Friday night of Oaks and all you need to get in is a $5 Pegasis Pin (which can be purchased at the gate). Who wouldn't want to eat deliciously fried food, drink local beer and listen to live and local musicians at the waterfront? Its like a hillbilly dream come true!
</p>

<p>
The Pegasis Parade is held on the first Thursday of May and I believe there is a love-hate relationship with most Louisvillians and this parade. The parade is great for local community as it showcases many of Louisville's local businesses and charities as well as providing a feeing of togetherness as people line the downtown streets to clap and cheer as the floats drive past. At the same time, this festival means those downtown streets are closed off. So for those people hoping to work a half day or leave work at a decent time, they must navigate through traffic in order to get to their Thurby party on time. 
</p>

<p>
Yes I said it. THURBY. Thurby (THUrsday of deRBY) is essentially a reason for everyone to get off work early and go to Churchill Downs on Thursday. Because it is to difficult to wait until Friday for Oaks racing or Saturday for Derby! Horses are running on Thursday, although the races are not as important as the races on Friday and Saturday. So the entrance fees are lower and they still serve bourbon and have live music. Whats not to love?
</p>

<p>
Lastly, and probably the most obvious reason people love the Kentucky Derby, is the entire atmosphere of Churchill downs. The bets being placed, fancy clothes and big hats everywhere, celebrities walking around, bourbon, friends, and fun. That is what the Kentucky Derby is all about. If I had to describe it in one sentence it would be this: "The Kentucky Derby is the Margi Gras of horse racing only classier"
