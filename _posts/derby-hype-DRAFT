First off, happy Cinco De Mayo!! The holiday that many believe is to celebrate the Mexican's Independence Day, although the fifth of May is actually celebrated as the day the Mexican Army overtook the French Army in the Battle of Puebla in 1852. Thanks, Google.

If you're not into drinking margaritas then don't worry. The first week of May also brings a different reason to celebrate. Well at least if you live in Kentucky or love horse racing. The first weekend in May is also the infamous Kentucky Derby horse race. Yes the events span just a Friday and Saturday, although the celebrations last an entire week. Many may wonder why there is such a hype over one of the fastest events in sports. Well here is why.

Chow Wagon, Pegasis parade, getting off work early, like Mardi Gras for Kentucky, Celebraties, Money.

In case you didn't know, Kentucky is home to hundreds of horse farms.
