First off, happy Cinco De Mayo!! The holiday that many believe is to celebrate the Mexican's Independence Day, although the fifth of May is actually celebrated as the day the Mexican Army overtook the French Army in the Battle of Puebla in 1852. Thanks, Google.

If you're not into drinking margaritas then don't worry. The first week of May also brings a different reason to celebrate; at least if you live in Kentucky or love horse racing. The first weekend in May is always home to the infamous Kentucky Derby horse race. Yes the races span just a Friday and Saturday, although the celebrations last an entire week. Many may wonder why there is such hype over one of the fastest events in sports. Well here is why. 
</p>

<p><code>
FYI: There are two major races in the first weekend of May. The first is "Kentucky Oaks" which is on Friday; the second is "The Kentucky Derby" which is on Saturday. Many refer to the entire day of racing as "Oaks" or "The Derby", although that is technically incorrect. There is one race on Friday named "Longines Kentucky Oaks" and there is one race on Saturday name "The Kentucky Derby". All other racing done on those days are for other purposes that just happen to be on the same day and in the same track.

With all of the traditions and love for horses in the Blue Grass state (and surrounding states) there is no surprise why many would get excited about one of the largest horses races (and largest parties) of the year. But for the locals there is more to it. The days leading up to the Oaks and Derby races are filled with events such as the Chow Wagon, the Pegasus Parade, the Derby marathon, Derby themed parties and nightlife every day of the week, and of course Thurby.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://kdf.org/">Kentucky Derby Festival</a> in Louisville kicks off the Derby season with the running of the Derby mini and full marathon on the last weekend in April. Technically the Kentucky Derby Festival starts about a week earlier at the Thunder Over Louisville fireworks and air show, although I don't really get in the Derby mindset until the marathon since that is the signal we are only a week away from race day. From the end of the marathon until the final race at Churchill Downs there is always something to do in Louisville.
</p>

<p>
The Chow Wagon is essentially a county fair in downtown Louisville. There are trailers and booths selling deep fried everything, beer, bourbon slushies, helicopter rides over the city, kids rides, and live music. The best part is all of this within walking distance from any building downtown or a short drive from the University of Louisville as well as Churchill downs. The Chow Wagon runs from the end of April until the Friday night of Oaks and all you need to get in is a $5 Pegasis Pin (which can be purchased at the gate). Who wouldn't want to eat deliciously fried food, drink local beer and listen to live and local musicians at the waterfront? Its like a hillbilly dream come true!
</p>

<p>
The Pegasus Parade is held on the first Thursday of May and I believe there is a love-hate relationship with most Louisvillians and this parade. The parade is great for local community as it showcases many of Louisville's local businesses and charities as well as providing a feeing of togetherness as people line the downtown streets to clap and cheer as the floats drive past. At the same time, this parade means those downtown streets are closed off. So for those people hoping to work a half day or leave work at a decent time, they must navigate through traffic in order to get to their Thurby party on time. 
</p>

<p>
Yes I said it. THURBY. Thurby (THUrsday of deRBY) is essentially a reason for everyone to get off work early and go to Churchill Downs on Thursday. Because it is to difficult to wait until Friday for Oaks racing or Saturday for Derby! Horses are running on Thursday, although the races are not as important as the races on Friday and Saturday. So the entrance fees are lower and they still serve bourbon and have live music. Whats not to love?
</p>

<p>
I've only listed a few of the amazing events that go on because I could go on for days finding new events that I didn't even know about. Overall, people love the Kentucky Derby because of the entire atmosphere of Churchill downs. The bets being placed, fancy clothes and big hats everywhere, celebrities walking around, bourbon, friends, and fun. That is what the Kentucky Derby is all about. It is a time where everyone can feel like a big wig while dressed to the nines, buying drinks, and making bets. It is the biggest party anyone will ever go to.
