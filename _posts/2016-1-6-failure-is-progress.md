When I was a kid I was always scared. Scared to go to the same school I had always gone to, with the same friends I had always known, on the same bus and with the same teachers. I was so scared I would often have panic attacks, before I left my house, to the point of throwing up all of the water I had drank to combat the dry mouth I had from said panic attack. But every time it happened, I would look up at my mom and dad as they handed me a towel and say, "I have no idea why I am so nervous?!". I was not bullied, nor failing school. I enjoyed my classes and sports. I believe I was just genuinly scared to fail.
