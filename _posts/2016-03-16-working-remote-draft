March 14, 2016 was the first day of working remote in Phoenix, AZ. Needless to say it has been a change from working in an office in Louisville, KY. Working remote provides its own set of pros and cons and here is what I have experienced so far. <!--endpreview-->

Working remote allows me to travel the country with Rachael as she is working at different hospitals as a travel nurse. It allows more time to spend with Boone doing the things we truly want to do. Yes, I am talking about going to the park. Since I am working 5am to 2pm, in order to match up with the Louisville office, we have the entire evening to explore the city and plan out our adventures.
