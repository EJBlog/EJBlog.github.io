March 14, 2016 was the first day of working remote in Phoenix, AZ. Needless to say it has been a change from working in an office in Louisville, KY. Working remotely provides its own set of pros and cons, and after a week I have learned a lot. <!--endpreview-->

Originally, I thought the person that chose to work from home full time was the same person who has young kids and no way to get them to daycare. I can see how people could take advantage of this benefit by watching TV or managing their own personal tasks rather than the work assigned by their employer. Lets be honest here, its easy to throw in a load of laundry while muted on a conference call. Maybe thats why Yahoo!'s CEO, Marissa Mayer, disagrees with telecommuting. In the last seven days, my opinion of working remotely has changed. I have realized, it is actually for those people that are dedicated to their profession and have enough focus to get their tasks done, day in and day out. 

Being in a place where your personal life collides with your professional life will inevitably create conflicts. Talk about work - life balance. Those that are successful must be persistant, have the ability to prioritize tasks, be self motivated and self aware. This relates to personally as well as professionally. 

The benefits of working from home seem obvious to me; More time to sleep due to the fact that there isn't a morning commute. It allows time for someone to help their kids get ready for school or help an elderly relative with their medications. There are countless benefits like this but each decision must be made with the mindset of knowing how much is too much. 

For me, working remote allows me to travel the country with Rachael as she is working at different hospitals as a travel nurse. Working 5am to 2pm in Phoenix (in order to match up with the Louisville office) gives Rachael, Boone, and I the entire evening to explore the area and plan out new adventures. Through everything, working remote is teaching me to be more concience of my work as well as my time. It would be easy to skip out early to go hiking while my laptop says I am still online or take an "extended lunch break" to watch the a new season on Netflix. The reason I choose not to do those things is because I know my work is my most important priority. If I did not make work my top priority then none of this would be possible.

I could go on for days about all of the positives, although there are definitely negatives associated with this as well. Starting work 5am is also a con, for obvious reasons.
