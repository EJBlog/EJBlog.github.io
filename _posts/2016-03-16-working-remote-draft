March 14, 2016 was the first day of working remote in Phoenix, AZ. Needless to say it has been a change from working in an office in Louisville, KY. Working remote provides its own set of pros and cons and after a week, I have learned a lot. <!--endpreview-->

I thought working from home was for the person who got tired of driving into the office and wanted some free vacation days. Or the person who has young kids and no way to get them to daycare so they work from home to take care of them. I can see how people could take advantage of this benefit by watching TV or doing their own personal work rather than the work assigned by their employer. Its easy to stumble out of bed, grab your laptop, and sit on the couch with the TV remote in your hand. But what I have realized is, working remotely is actually for the people that are dedicated to their profession and have enough focus to get their tasks done, day in and day out.

Working remote allows me to travel the country with Rachael as she is working at different hospitals as a travel nurse. It allows more time to spend with Boone doing the things we truly want to do. Yes, I am talking about going to the park. Since I am working 5am to 2pm, in order to match up with the Louisville office, we have the entire evening to explore the city and plan out our adventures.
