March 14, 2016 was the first day of working remote in Phoenix, AZ. Needless to say it has been a change from working in an office in Louisville, KY. Working remotely provides its own set of pros and cons and after a week, I have learned a lot. <!--endpreview-->

I thought working from home was for the person who got tired of driving into the office and wanted some free vacation days. Or the person who has young kids and no way to get them to daycare. I can see how people could take advantage of this benefit by watching TV or doing their own personal tasks rather than the work assigned by their employer. Lets be honest here, its easy to throw in a load of laundry while muted on a conference call. Maybe thats why Yahoo!'s CEO, Marissa Mayer, disagrees with telecommuting. I have realized, working remotely is actually for the people that are dedicated to their profession and have enough focus to get their tasks done, day in and day out.

The people that can work remotely while finishing their work to the best of their ability show persistance, the ability to prioritize their tasks, motivation, and self awareness. This relates to personally as well as professionally. 

The benefits of working from home seem obvious to me. Being at home allows more time to sleep due to the fact that there isnt't a morning commute to work. It allows time for someone to help their kids get ready for school or help an elderly relative with their medications. There are countless benefits like this. 

For me, working remote allows me to travel the country with Rachael as she is working at different hospitals as a travel nurse. Working 5am to 2pm in Phoenix (in order to match up with the Louisville office) gives Rachael, Boone, and I the entire evening to explore the area and plan out new adventures. Through everything, working remote is teaching me to be more concence of my work as well as my time. My work is my most important priority because if I was not blessed with the opportunity to work at home then none of this would be possible.

I could go on for days about all of the positives, although there are definitely negatives associated with this as well.
