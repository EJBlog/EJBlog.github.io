<p>Networking this, personal branding that. As a recently graduated young professional, that’s all I hear about these days. The list of items required for successful, continuous career development is never-ending. Don’t get me wrong, the future of my career is very important to me, but it can be a little overwhelming. So I decided to take it one step at a time. <!--endpreview-->
<br><br>
<b>Step 1: Social Media Management</b>
	<b>Online presence</b> for a recent college graduate looking to advance their career is everything. It’s becoming common knowledge that employers are going to look up potential job candidates online before even awarding them an interview. Now I could go on to list pages of examples of what an employer might find online that would prevent them from considering someone for an interview, but that’s not the point of this post and there are plenty of articles online explaining how to best manage and clean up your presence online. The point is, it’s important to clean up and/or monitor any publicly accessible information online. Majority of the time, this information is being obtained from social media accounts.<br><br>
	Social media accounts can be the difference between landing a job and not making it past the first round of applicants. In my opinion, there are two options to consider before applying for a job: clean up your profiles so that they are appropriate for the position or make sure the information is private. Sometimes even if you think the information is protected, you could be wrong. Therefore, the safe bet is to remove inappropriate content and keep your accounts job-friendly. On the other hand, if you believe in a separation between personal life and professional life, create separate social media accounts. Make sure one reflects your interests, career goals, aspirations, etc. The other one can then remain private to your own personal life. That’s all there is to it.

<b>Step 2: Building a Personal Brand</b>
	Although it may not be true in all career fields, I believe personal websites are becoming the new and advanced resumes. They offer more information than a typical resume, while allowing the individual to display some of their personality through design and creativity. This is why I decided to build one myself. As I am writing this first blog post, my site is still a work in progress but it is coming along. It is not only an enjoyable and beneficial side project, it helps to hone and improve my web development skills.
	Obviously, a personal website is not the only way to build your personal brand. You need to create a good, strong reputation for yourself. You need to <b>sell yourself</b>. Make employers want to reach out to you or at the very least, keep you in the back of their mind for possible future opportunities. The only way to do this is by being <b>authentic</b>. Portray yourself as the professional you really are, not the professional you want people to think you are. There are many ways to achieve this.
<ul>
	<li>Work harder than everyone else</li>
	<li>Dress like a professional</li>
	<li>Never stop learning about your particular career field</li>
	<li>Define your goals and make them known</li>
	<li><b>NETWORK</b></li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Step 3: Network Expansion</b>
	If you ask me, this has to be the most obvious step. Any person you ask for advice on moving forward in your career is going to tell you that the key is networking. As much as possible. All the time. The more connections you make while networking, the better off you will be. Although it is an ongoing debate, I believe there is a lot of truth to the phrase “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”
Networking isn’t always as easy as being outgoing and talking to a lot of new people. Although that helps, you also have to make the effort to attend networking events, go to group meetings with like-minded individuals, find mentors, connect with other professionals online, and so on. The amount of effort you put into this has everything to do with how effectively you are able to expand your network. This is not something that will happen by itself, hard work is a necessity.

Just to set things straight, I am by no means an expert on this. I’m not experienced with writing blogs. I’m just giving my opinion on some things that I think are helpful with career development. Like the title of the post says, it’s just one young professional giving advice to other young professionals who are willing to read it.
