Buckle up your seat belts, lift up your trays, and prepare for take off.

Friends, a lot can happen in a year. A LOT. <!--endpreview-->Last year in my fourth and final year of undergrad at 

the University of Louisville I went to Disney for spring break with my then serious girlfriend of 

four years; however, this year was not quite the same.  Being in my first year of graduate school 

and having a different spring break than most of all my friends I decided to do things a little 

differently. This year I traveled alone for the first time out west to Seattle, Washington.
</p>

<p>
Like Lewis & Clark and so many other Americans thereafter I was beckoned to the West. Luckily, 

through saving up and planning I was able to make my dream trip a success. I was there for only 

three days, but it was trip I will never forget. If you have never traveled alone, DO IT. And do it with an open mind.
</p>

<p>
Coming from a small town in western Kentucky to one of the largest cities in western America 

there are a few cultural differences. Even though I was in downtown Seattle for all of my trip it 

was still the freshest air I feel that I have ever felt and breathed. I didn’t know if I should have 

thanked Seattle’s liberalism, the evergreen trees, Mt. Rainier in the distance, or the chilled 

winds of the North, but whatever it is, they are doing it right.
</p>

<p>
What truly led me to Seattle as my spring break destination over getting black out drunk on a 

beach was soccer. The greatest game that hardly is in North America. My favorite overall sports 

team is the Seattle Sounders who have players such as Clint Dempsey, Jordan Morris, and Brad 

Evans, players who see significant playing time for the national team. I was pleasantly shocked 

to find that Seattle ABSOLUTELY LOVES ITS TEAMS. The support for the Sounders, Seahawks, 

and Mariners was fascinating and possibly why MLS (Major League Soccer) support in Seattle in 

practically unparalleled any where else in the U.S.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, I was able to find a ticket in the supporter zone not knowing what I would be getting 

into. IT. GOT. ROWDY. Soccer supporters love their teams with a passion that can hardly be 

rivaled, in my opinion. Unfortunately, my Sounders lost that home opener (and are still on a 

losing streak, get it together boys), but what made the game an amazing experience were the 

fans. And what an eclectic group they were.

<p>
I was welcomed with high fives (and strangely, hugs) from most everyone in a 3 row radius 

welcoming me to their city. The guy next to me with dreads who probably hadn’t showered in a 

week asked me if I had enjoyed the city’s “greenery”. When I said I hadn’t and that I had 

forgotten that marijuana in Washington was legal he gave me a large Chesire Cat smile and 

said, “Man, Kentucky is wild.” I couldn’t tell if he was talking about me or the state in general, 

but it made me think about how diverse and great this country really is even if the political 

situation makes it seem we are at each other’s throats. 
</p>

<p>
For me, my time in Seattle was a time other introspection over the past year and future plans 

while living in the moment and taking in the city. By staying downtown, I walked practically 

everywhere. I walked until I got lost and that’s when I knew I was where I exactly needed to be. 

I did the touristy things: visited the Space Needle, the aquarium, the world famous Pike Market, 

and drank my fair share of Starbucks and local craft beer, but getting lost in the city and finding 

random pubs and bars to mingle in were some of my favorite moments.
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself wanting to get away, even for a few days, but you can’t find anyone else to 

go with you just go for it. As the wise prophet Shia LeBouf said, “JUST DO IT!” You will not 

regret it and you do not necessarily have to leave the U.S. to have a “foreign” experience. There 

is a world out there and it could even be a 4 hour plane ride in any direction.
