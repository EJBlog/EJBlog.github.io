Living in Kentucky, we have a hard time finding good snow for a yearly ski trip. <!--endpreview--> There are a couple places in Indiana, which are barely skiable most of the winter season, although I am thankful for those places because that is where most of us got our start.
2015 was the first year I was able to get a group of friends to head to a larger mountain for a ski/snowboard trip. We drove 7 hours to Snowshoe, West Virginia for a 4 day trip.

This year, through a great deal of planning, we have booked a trip to Solitude Mountain in Utah! We found cheap flights through Southwest and Frontier Airlines into Salt Lake City, Utah and will be taking a rental car up to the resort where we will be for 4 nights.
We will be skiing Solitude and Brighton Mountains.

Pictures and videos to come when we return!
