First off, happy Cinco De Mayo! The holiday that many believe is to celebrate the Mexican's Independence Day, although the fifth of May is actually celebrated as the day the Mexican Army overtook the French Army in the Battle of Puebla in 1852. Thanks, Google. But for Kentuckians and horse racing aficionados across the world, today is a part of Derby week. <!--endpreview-->

If you're not into drinking margaritas then don't worry. The first week of May also brings a different reason to celebrate; at least if you live in Kentucky or love horse racing. The first weekend in May is always home to the famous Kentucky Oaks and Derby horse races. The races span just a Friday and Saturday, although the celebrations last much longer. Many may wonder why there is such hype over one of the fastest events in sports. Well here is why. 
</p>

<p><code>
FYI: There are two major races in the first weekend of May. The first is "Kentucky Oaks" which is on Friday; the second is "The Kentucky Derby" which is on Saturday. Many refer to the entire day of racing as "Oaks" or "The Derby", although that is technically incorrect. There is one race on Friday named "Longines Kentucky Oaks" and there is one race on Saturday name "The Kentucky Derby". All other racing done on those days are for other purposes that just happen to be on the same day and in the same track.

With all of the traditions and love for horses in the Blue Grass state (and surrounding states) there is no surprise why many would get excited about one of the largest horses races (and largest parties) of the year. But for the locals there is more to it. The days leading up to the Oaks and Derby races are filled with events such as the Chow Wagon, the Pegasus Parade, the Derby marathon, Derby themed parties and nightlife every day of the week, and of course Thurby.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://kdf.org/">Kentucky Derby Festival</a> in Louisville kicks off the Derby season with the running of the Derby mini and full marathon on the last weekend in April. Technically the Kentucky Derby Festival starts about a week earlier at the Thunder Over Louisville fireworks and air show, although I don't really get in the Derby mindset until the marathon since that is the signal we are only a week away from race day. From the end of the marathon until the final race at Churchill Downs there is always something to do in Louisville.
</p>

<p>
The Chow Wagon is essentially a county fair in downtown Louisville. There are trailers and booths selling deep fried everything, beer, bourbon slushies, helicopter rides over the city, kids rides, and live music. The best part is all of this within walking distance from any building downtown or a short drive from Churchill Downs. The Chow Wagon runs from the end of April until the Friday night of Oaks and all you need to get in is a $5 Pegasis Pin (which can be purchased at the gate). Who wouldn't want to eat deliciously fried food, drink local beer, and listen to live and local musicians at the waterfront? Its like a hillbilly dream come true!
</p>

<p>
The Pegasus Parade is held on the first Thursday of May and I believe there is a love-hate relationship with most Louisvillians and this parade. The parade is great for local community as it showcases many of Louisville's local businesses and charities as well as providing a feeing of togetherness as people line the downtown streets to clap and cheer as the floats drive past. At the same time, this parade means those downtown streets are closed off. So for those people hoping to work a half day or leave work at a decent time, they must navigate through traffic in order to get to their Thurby party on time. 
</p>

<p>
Yes I said it. THURBY. Thurby (THUrsday of deRBY) is essentially a reason for everyone to get off work early and go to Churchill Downs on Thursday. Because it is to difficult to wait until Friday for Oaks racing or Saturday for Derby! Horses are running on Thursday, although the races are not as important as the races on Friday and Saturday. So the entrance fees are lower and they still serve bourbon and have live music. Whats not to love? But realistically Louisville is partying every night of the week. There are VIP lounges, clubs, and bars hosting events each night leading up to the big race. This is a college students dream especially since the University's finals week is scheduled so exams are finished before Derby weekend. Coincidence? I think not.
</p>

<p>
Oaks day is on Friday so most people have taken this day off work completely. This may be because they had too much fun at Thurby but thats none of our business ("Kermit the frog sips his tea"). A ticket to Oaks is much less expensive than a ticket on Derby day so a lot of the locals go to Oaks. The atmosphere is still electric like Derby day, although you might not see as many celebrities and you will probably see more sloppy drunks. Also, you may notice a lot of people wearing Pink. Pink is the theme to help support breast and ovarian cancer so be sure to at least wear a pink tie, socks, or oversized hat!

Derby day is the day we have all been waiting for. The day we often see a horse and jocky fighting for a chance at history in an attempt at the triple crown of horse racing. This day you will see private jets flying in from all over the world and Limos dropping off millionaires at the front door. Everyone is dressed in their best suites and dresses. Money is in the air and Churchill Downs is buzzing with excitement. The Kentucky Derby is a time where anyone can feel like The Great Gatsby. It is the biggest party anyone will ever go to and you will want to come back every year. There is nothing else like it.
