I imagine a lot of people read the title of this post and think, “This is going to be like every other article telling me why I shouldn’t be eating bad food and how I need to spend every day exercising or working out.” Nope, not this one.

To start off, I’m not going to tell you that it’s easy to eat whatever you want all the time without exercising and also be a healthy individual at the same time. Some people choose to monitor what they eat and keep the unhealthy food to a minimum. 
Others choose to eat whatever they want, but exercise or workout a lot. Some even do both and are probably living a very healthy life. I’m also not going to tell you which one is best, I’m just going to <b>advise</b> you to pick one. Be aware. 
Do something that works best for you and is going to benefit the overall well-being of your body.

The title of this post is “Investing In Your Body.” The reason I named it that way is because so many people preach about how short life is and how you have to take advantage of every day, every moment. 
How can you live out these days and these moments if you’re sick, unhealthy, uncomfortable, hurting in some way throughout your life? Chances are it’s only going to get worse as you get older… Unless you do something about it. 
If you have the capability to better your current state, why not take advantage of that? Yes, that may mean getting out of your comfort zone and making sacrifices such as cutting down on fast food, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or putting on those dusty, unused running shoes every once in a while but those small things can go a long way.

What motivates you more than anything else? First answer that question and then use it to push yourself to be a happier and healthier person. Do it for your own self confidence. Do it to be better than average. 
Do it for the “wow, look at them now.” Do it for whatever reason you want, but actually <b>do something</b>… Or don’t. It’s your choice.
