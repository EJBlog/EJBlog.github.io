When Jake and I first moved to Phoenix, we made an “Arizona Bucket List” within the first week, I mean who wouldn’t? What I was forgetting to take into account was mine, and Jake’s, life bucket list. Having worked the night before, Jake woke me up around 1pm like a kid on Christmas morning. He asked, “Guess what we are going to do?” Jake had found a great deal on Groupon for skydiving at Phoenix Area Skydiving. Needless to say, I was ecstatic, because this is something Jake and I have talked about knocking off of our bucket list for years!  <!--endpreview-->
</p>
<p>
I tend to be a procrastinator at times and Jake tends to get ants in his pants the longer it takes to get things carried out. So, it was no surprise Jake brought up when we would want to go skydiving. On Saturday, March 26th Jake called Phoenix Area Skydiving to schedule our skydiving date and time. It was final; we would jump out of a plane on Sunday, April 3. 
</p>
<p>
It’s finally Sunday, April 3. Today is the day we get to jump out of a plane! I woke up at 12pm, after working the night before. We went to grab a hearty brunch and then drove to Casa Grande, AZ. We arrived at the skydiving facility and completed the legal documents necessary to sky dive, which in summary said, “Skydiving is dangerous. If an injury occurs or you die, it is not our fault”. We met our instructors who suited us up! Afterwards, they went through brief instructions on how to jump out of the plane. Brief is not an understatement either. 
</p>
<p>
Within 30 minutes of arriving at Phoenix Area Skydiving, we were waiting at the Casa Grande Municipal Airport for our plane to take us to an altitude of 10,000 ft. The plane arrived and to our dismay, was extremely small. Since I am the procrastinator and Jake has to do things now, we decided Jake would jump first! I hopped in the plane first with my instructor, and then Jake with his instructor. We were off, flying high into the sky.
</p>
<p>
Once we reached the desired altitude, Jake’s instructor put down the novel he was reading and screamed “DOOR!!!”. Next thing we knew he threw opened the side door. I didn’t hear him yell, so it was no surprise that I was startled when I heard this huge bang and big rush of wind coming into the plane. It was Jake’s time to shine! First his left leg on the outdoor ledge, then his right. This was the most challenging part for Jake since he is a giant in this very small plane. Before the blink of an eye, Jake and his instructor were out of the plane. Now, it was my turn! Left leg on the ledge, then my right leg, time to jump! 
</p>
<p>
I jumped with the help of my instructor, obviously. Wind blowing in my hair, mouth dryer than anything I have felt before, and cheeks puffing up so bad from the wind I couldn’t help but think, “Man this is what Boone (our dog) must feel like when her face is out the car window going 70+ MPH”. It seemed so surreal to me that I was free falling, doing spins and more free falling. With the blink of en eye, my instructor pulled the knob to open the parachute. 
</p>
<p>
We debriefed for a moment as we were parasailing down to the ground, mainly him asking me questions on how I was feeling. He was asking me questions on how my stomach was feeling and overall how I felt. He commented and said, “You didn’t even seem nervous”. Whether it was because of the awe inspiring Arizona views from an aerial point of view or controlling my nurse-driven adrenaline, I was not nervous whatsoever. 
</p>
<p>
We did turns with the parachute in each direction, which he was kind enough to let me take the reins. Before I could believe it, it was time to land. Landing was easy and smooth sailing.  Luckily, Jake was in the landing zone waiting for me! Once on the ground, Jake and I debriefed over the amazing experience we had just accomplished. Unfortunately, Jake and I did not purchase the video package for multiple reasons; one, it was super expensive for one person. Two, with a world devoted to social media postings, it was nice to have this experience solely between Jake and myself. Third, it is an amazing experience to live in the moment and remember this life experience that way. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, I can speak on behalf of Jake and myself when we had a blast! Phoenix Area Skydiving was amazing and our instructors were phenomenal, which I know allowed me to literally trust this person with my life. Skydiving is an incredible experience to witness and I would highly recommend you try it out!
