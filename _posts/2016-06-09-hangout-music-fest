So you’ve made the decision to go to Hangout Music Festival in Gulf Shores, AL. Now you’re doing your preparatory pre-festival research just as I did. Here’s what you need to know to get the most out of your trip. <!--endpreview-->
<br><br>
Now on the plus side, many of the things you could forget to bring are able to be purchased once you are down there but the prices are going to be much higher than normal. Save yourself time and money and just bring the essentials with you.
<br><br>
<h3><b>Pack light on the clothing!</b></h3>
<br>
90% of your time at Hangout Fest is going to be spent on the beach or inside the music festival. You could very easily survive the whole time with a couple pairs of swimming trunks/bathing suits and a few tank tops. The only time we wore anything nicer than beach attire was out to dinner one night. There is no need to pack lots of outfits.
<br><br>
<b>Flip flops or sandals</b> are an absolute necessity. You will need them while waiting in line on the hot pavement leading into the festival. Make sure to bring something to tie them onto or find a creative way to hold them when you aren’t wearing them. Once you get on the sand, you aren’t going to want to walk around in your flip flops. If you are carrying a Camelbak or any type of backpack, bring a carabineer or string to attach them if they can’t find inside the bag. Personally, I used an old shoelace to tie them onto the back of my Camelbak and it worked great. My buddy, on the other hand, had his flip flops stolen out of the easily-accessible pouch on his backpack. You’d be surprised by the price of flip flops in the area when you’re looking for a cheap replacement for the weekend.
<br><br>
<h3><b>Invest in a Camelbak (or some knockoff brand)</b></h3>
<br>
Seems like an obvious piece of advice, but staying hydrated as much as possible makes all the difference when you’re trying to survive the 12-hour day out in the sun (especially if alcohol is involved). There are fill-up stations scattered throughout the festival that allow you to fill up any backpack bladder or water bottle for free as many times as you want. <b>Take full advantage of that.</b>
<br><br>
<h3><b>Book a place to stay early</b></h3>
<br>
The earlier you book a condo or hotel in Gulf Shores, the better price and location you will get. I highly recommend getting a place as close as possible to the festival (obviously right?). There are a few reasons I say that. We booked a place within half a mile from the entrance of the festival and it worked out perfectly. We saved $50 each on shuttle passes, we were able to walk home during breaks in the day to eat/relax/refill, we didn’t have to wait for rides or designate a driver all weekend, and we could hear and see the music from our balcony.
<br><br>
The earlier you lock down a good location, the better off you will be when you get there and you won’t be disappointed. Don’t wait to book.
<br><br>
 <h3><b>Other useful tips</b></h3>
<br><br>
Bring plenty of sunscreen. Chances are, other people in your group will forget and yours will end up becoming the community sunscreen. Regardless, make sure someone has it. You will be out in the sun 12+ hours for three days straight. Trust me, you will want/need it. 
<br><br>
For those of you looking to bring GoPro’s or other video cameras, this is important. <b>You can bring in the camera, but nothing else.</b> I saw some people who managed to bring in a selfie stick, flagpole, and other attachments but most of them were all confiscated or the person received a warning. I brought my GoPro in with me each day and just took videos/pictures with my hand in the air or gave it to my taller friends. They are strict about searching when you enter the festival and they treat most camera accessories as weapons (poles, mounts, etc.) so be warned. Bring valuable items in at your own risk. 
<br><br>
Last but not least, bring a koozie or two into the festival with you if you plan on buying drinks. To avoid the long lines, my friends and I would purchase two beers at a time. The problem is, each day it was between 80 and 90 degrees so the beers will get warm very quickly. This leaves you with two options: drink quickly or keep them as cold as possible with the help of a koozie. If you want to finish them before they get warm, more power to you. But 12 hours a day on the beach out in the sun is not an ideal situation to be chugging beer (in my opinion). 
<br><br>
Overall, I would recommend this music festival to anyone and everyone. It was an amazing experience and we got to see an amazing lineup (image below). You can watch the official 2016 Hangout Music Fest video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nKWQok2MRE">here</a>. <b>Happy Hangout!</b>
