Winter in Kentucky means climbing the local gyms. This is what I do for training in the off season. <!--endpreview--> 

Even though climbing in a gym can be a little mundane and repetitive, it is still necessary in order to progress as a climber. Here is what I like to do in order to keep up my strength and endurance for the climbing season.

<strong>Strength</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Bouldering - Working on (projecting) new and more difficult bouldering routes helps with strength and technique. Try to focus on inverted routes.</li>
  <li>Campus Rungs - Pick a rung where you can hang with two hands and feet off the ground. Begin by keeping your left hand on that rung while moving your right hand up the rungs, one by one. Begin moving your right hand up the rungs by twos and threes and so on. Switch hands. Repeat this three to four times.</li>
  <li>Olmpic Rings - Muscle Ups are always a great way to engage the core, back, arms, and shoulders.</li>
  <li>Weighted Pull ups or Pull downs - If you dont have machines to do pull downs, weighted pull ups (pull ups with weights attached to a belt to add resistance) are a great way to gain strength in your arms and back. If you can do fifteen pull ups you need to add weight.</li>
  <li>Squats - Legs are a very important aspect of climbing that often gets overlooked. Squats are one of the best workouts for your legs and core muscles. Start with low weight until you can ensure you have proper form to reduce risk of injury. Do three sets of 10 and increase weights once that becomes easier.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<strong>Endurance</strong>
<ol>
<li>Traversing - Begin with at least two laps along your favorite wall of traversing. The longer you can stay on the wall, the better</li>
<li>Campus Board hangs - Choose the grip size that is most challenging for you and try to hang for 30 seconds then take a 30 second break. Repeat this four to five times</li>
<li>Campus Rungs - Pick a rung where you can hang with two hands and both feet off the ground. Begin climbing up the rungs like a ladder using only your hands. Attempt to climb to the top and back down. Do this four to five times.</li>
<li>Pull ups to fail - do as many concecutive pull ups as you possibly can. Do three sets.</li>
<li>Running/cardio - Get out there and get the heart pumping. This will help your blood flow for those moments in a crux when you need it most</li>
</ol>

For those that are new to campus boarding, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L861czXKGaI">helpful video</a> to get you started. Here are the climbing gyms in the Louisville area where I like to do my training <a href="http://www.climbrocksport.com/">Rocksport</a> and <a href="http://climbnulu.com/">Climb Nulu</a>.
