How do you know where to settle down and spend the rest of your life?
<br><br><!--endpreview-->
	I have to believe I’m not the only one who thinks about this fairly often. Unless you’ve visited <b>every</b> country, <b>every</b> state, <b>every</b> city or small town, how can you really know where you would most enjoy living out the rest of your life? You can’t. 
<br><br>
	For those of you who are one hundred percent sure where you want to live, work, raise a family, etc. feel free to stop reading the rest of this post. I am writing this for those people who, like me, aren’t sure where the best place to establish a permanent residence is. There are so many things to consider when picking a place to live: <br>
<ul>
	<li>Distance from the rest of your family</li>
	<li>Job and career growth opportunities</li>
<li>Safety for you and your family</li>
<li>Good education options</li>
<li>Weather preferences</li>
</ul><br>
Those are all important factors and still, they don’t take into consideration the opinion of a possible significant other you may be moving with. He or she could have a completely different idea for both of your futures, and it might include moving to a different location than you had in mind. So how do you make this important life choice? No idea, but I can at least give my opinion on it. 
<br><br>
	While I was still in college, it was easy to convince myself that I didn’t need to worry about this until I graduated. When that time came, I was nowhere closer to knowing where I wanted to work and live. Now graduated from college and working in the same city I went to school in, I’ve realized it’s time to start making moves. Seeing as I already love to travel and explore new places, my plan is simple. <br>
<ol>
	<li> Make a list of all the cities you want to visit or would consider living in.</li>
<li> Break them up into two categories: destinations that you’re able and willing to drive to and destinations that you aren’t.</li>
<li> Put them in priority from the most desire to visit to the least.</li>
<li> Sit down with a friend or significant other and start planning trips. Think about weekend trips for the destinations that are in driving distance and maybe use some vacation days for the destinations that aren’t.</li>
<li> Start traveling.</li>
</ol><br>
Making and prioritizing a list of trips is much easier to do than actually following through with them. Over time, the goal is to knock as many locations off your list as possible. Down the road, whether you’ve finished your whole list or only made it on one trip, you will still have a better idea of where you might want to establish a life based off of your experiences on those trips. Don’t take it from me, find out for yourself. <b>Happy traveling!</b>
