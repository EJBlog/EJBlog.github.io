<p>I enjoy going to gym and playing sports because it allows me to relieve stress and get my mind off the obligatory tasks of the world. But don't get me wrong, I also want to become a little bigger and stronger. 
In order to do that I realized <!--endpreview--> I need to eat a lot more... Like a whole lot more.</p>

<p>
I have been going to the gym consistently for about 3 years now and by no means do I consider myself "big", although I feel much stronger than when I started. 
When I say "consistently", I mean going to the gym an average of no less than four days a week doing heavy lifting. During those weeks, I also played some type of sport (basketball, softball, rock climbing, etc) once or twice a week.
</p>
<p>
When I started going to the gym I weighed about 170lbs and was lifting a respectable amount but all of my major lifts were under my body weight. 
Now, after three years, I weigh about 185lbs I am happy to say I can dead lift, squat, and bench press well past my body weight. 
Some people may say "why did it take you so long?" or "three years is a long time" and I say that is fine. 
I am not training to be a body builder or a model or anything other than a stronger and healthier me. 
</p>
<p>
Throughout the last few years I have taken protein shakes, pre workout supplements, creatine powders, and BACCs but I didn't see the results I was hoping for. 
The pre workout drinks made me jittery and every week I felt like I needed to double the serving size. The protein shakes varied from high calorie to low calorie; 
Chocolate, vanilla, and cookies and cream; Kroger brand and <a href="http://www.musclepharm.com/">Muscle Pharm</a>. No matter what type it was, the protein shakes always ended up getting old and began making me sick to my stomach.
Creatine powders always seemed pointless to me as it always came with the "its just water weight" line. The BACCs tasted great, although I didn't want to be that guy carrying around a water bottle of a red drink while lifting.
Lastly, all of these supplements began to get expensive.
</p>

<p>
While writing this I am thinking, "I sound like a hypocrite. I want the results but I don't want to use what everyone else has proven will work."
With that being said, I decided I am going to go with a different route. I love to eat but with my high metabolism and love of sports (which means cardio) I need to eat over 4000 calories a day.
Thats a lot of food. I mean, I love to eat but cmon... So I used <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/">BodyBuilding.com</a> to help me find some meals to prepare each week in order to consume the calories I want. 
</p>

<p>
Since I have started this meal plan, I feel better and have gained weight each week.
