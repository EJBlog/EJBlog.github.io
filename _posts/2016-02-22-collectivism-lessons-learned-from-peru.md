Collectivism is a word that isn’t too familiar to Americans.  It is a moral stance or idea that is used a lot in sociology, but why are we not too familiar with this term?<!--endpreview-->
<br><br>
It is because we are too focused on “I” and less focused on “Us.”  
<br><br>
Bill McKibben, author of the book Deep Economy (I highly recommend it!), uses the term “hyper-individualism.” His definition is the “tendency for people to act in a highly individual way, without regard to society.”  With our smartphones, social media, the money chase, the all for me, none for all mentality, there is no wonder why the sense of community is withering away in our country.
<br><br>
After exploring Peru for 2 weeks during the month of May with my father, I realized we have it all wrong.
<br><br>
From traveling on busses through little towns, trying frog soup in bustling markets, witnessing Machu Picchu (INCREDIBLE), 3 day backpacking trip on the Lares Trek, giving coloring books to children in the mountains, eating fried guinea pig, buying handmade bracelets to help support a family, etc. The trip to Peru was the best traveling experience I have ever had! I learned so much about the culture, the people, and the Peruvian history.  I could go on and on about how blessed I have been to be able to travel to such a fascinating country, BUT something struck me…
<br><br>
These people were poor. Some lived in make shift huts. They wore the same clothes for days, even weeks at a time. Each member of the family had a job. They worked for the survival of the family and to bring life to their community. Now, not all of Peru is underdeveloped. Lima, Peru is a thriving city (3rd largest in the Americas) and plenty live very well. The places I am talking about are in the hills and mountains; the people that live off the land.
<br><br>
Smiles. Laughter. Handshakes.  This is what I saw from these people. How on earth are they so happy with so little?
<br><br>
Community. That is why. They work together as a unit. They have meals together. They know everyone in their village. If a family is suffering, another steps in to help out. This is all they have.  Everyone knows the saying that “money cannot buy you happiness”, but a sense of community; a sense of belonging, DOES. 
<br><br>
Research suggests that people <b>“get happiness not just from doing things with others, but from doing things both with and for others.”</b> This means that we do not only find happiness by spending time with others or doing things collectively, but also from doing things for others.
<br><br>
Peru changed my life and changed the way I view different societies of the world.  As we fly through life, make sure you are able to stop and understand that “we” is stronger than “me.”
