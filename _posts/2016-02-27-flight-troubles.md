So far the ski trip to Utah has not gone as planned. Rachael dropped me off at the Covington/Cincinnati International Airport (CVG) at 4:15am (EST) so that I would be on time for my 5:45am Frontier Airlines flight to Denver. Before I could even worry about <!--endpreview--> if my backpack was going to pass as a carry on item, we were told that the flight has been delayed until 3pm due to maintenance issues. What does that even mean? The plane better need a new engine to warrant a delay like this!!!

Needless to say, I’m tired and slightly grumpy. Although, I’m happy to say I am not grumpy enough to be “that guy” who was yelling at the airline desk employees. I hope everyone understands that they are just doing what they are told. They are not in the position to determine what flies and what does not. The delay has been an inconvenience for everyone not just you! But I digress. 

After waiting in line for 20 min, I was able to get a refund from Frontier (thank goodness) and purchase a new, more reliable, flight to Salt Lake City. The American Airlines flight will get in later (due to the stops in Chicago and Dallas) and cost me more than double the Frontier flight but at least we can still make the trip happen. 

On the plus side I am meeting a good group of guys in Salt Lake City and they are going to pick me up from the airport in the rental mini van. Also, I have been able to work on our website!

The journey is half the fun and tribulations always make the best stories.

Onwards to Solitude Mountain!
