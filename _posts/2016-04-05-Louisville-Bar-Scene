The city of Louisville (Lou-a-vul for those of you aren't from around here) offers not only an incredible selection of food, but a wide variety of bars as well. No matter what type of scene you are looking for, there is a probably a bar for you. <!--endpreview-->
<br><br>
<b><h2>Downtown Area</h2></b>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://www.tavernon4thky.com/">Tavern (4th Street Live)</a></h3>
If you’re looking for a place to play games while grabbing a drink with some friends, this is your best bet. Pool, cornhole, ping pong, giant Jenga, bocce ball, shuffleboard, battle shots (like battleship but with shot glasses), a variety of arcade games, and more. Drinks are a bit pricey but if you go on a weekend you’ll more than likely find some great drink specials.
<br><br>
<h3><a href="http://thesportsandsocialclub.com/">Sports and Social (4th Street Live)</a></h3>
With the biggest space downtown to sit and watch the big game or fight, Sports and Social is a great hangout to take your friends. Lots of tables/ booths, a dance floor, and a handful of bars all serving drinks can be found here. This sports bar even offers bowling, which always makes a night of drinking more entertaining. 
<br><br>
<h3><a href="http://www.trollpub.com/">Troll Pub</a></h3>
Troll Pub serves as both a good restaurant and a good bar. Located right next to the KFC Yum! Center, this is a prime spot to grab some food and drinks before or after a basketball game, concert, or any other event. If you get a chance to stop by here, grab one of their many draft beers and my personal favorite, pretzels with beer cheese. You won’t be upset.
<br><br>
<h3><a href="http://doccrows.com/">Doc Crow’s</a></h3>
With one of the best whiskey and bourbon menus in town, Doc Crow’s is a downtown favorite of many. You could be seated with a view of people walking down Main Street, in a room with a nice view of the kitchen pandemonium, or in the dining area towards the rear of the building. No matter what, the bar and waiting staff is highly educated on the whiskey they have to offer, and can help if you are ever feeling overwhelmed about making a selection. Whether you are going for some great cocktails, some oysters from the delicious raw bar, or some BBQ, there is something that everyone can enjoy at Doc Crow’s. 
<br><br>
<h3><a href="http://www.garageonmarket.com/">Garage Bar</a></h3>
When people talk about the bar with the two wrecked cars out front, Garage Bar is what they’re referring to. If it feels good outside and you’re looking for a nice place to grab a drink and maybe play some ping pong on one of their tables, transformed out of old automobile rubbish, Garage Bar is the place to go. 
<br> <br>
<h3><a href="http://www.haymarketwhiskeybar.com/">Haymarket Whiskey Bar</a></h3>
If you’re looking for a nice dive bar with a huge selection of bourbon, look no further. Renowned as one of the best bourbon bars in the country, Haymarket Whiskey Bar offers over 150+ whiskeys from all over the world. Their selection includes the run of the rare Pappys, Jeffersons, and many more. Grab a unique bourbon, play a game of pinball, and enjoy the weird, but still cool, vibe that Haymarket Whiskey Bar brings. 
<br><br>
I can’t write this article without giving a tribute to the (now closed) <b>World Famous Sully’s Saloon</b> on 4th Street Live. No bar will ever recreate the mayhem that Sully’s provided every single weekend. You will be missed.
<br><br>
<b><h2>Bardstown Road Area</h2></b>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://holygralelouisville.com/">Holy Grale</a></h3>
Holy Grale, a small church transformed into a bar with an incredible selection of beers, what could get more interesting? If you want to try beers you and your friends have never heard of, Holy Grale is for you. Beers from all over the world, some on tap, some in bottles, some light, some dark, Holy Grale is changing and updating their selection constantly. Grab a small bite to eat and buy the kitchen staff a round while you’re at it – they will appreciate it! When the weather is nice, the back patio provides a fun and relaxing environment to hang out with a large group as well.
<br><br>
<h3><a href="http://www.thebackdoorlouisville.com/">The Back Door</a></h3>
Tucked away behind a small movie theatre/shopping center, the Back Door bar is a great place for some pool and <b>strong</b> drinks. In addition to having six or seven pool tables and an arcade room, this dive bar has a decent selection of food as well. If you’re lucky, you may even run into Rusty, the locally famous beef jerky guy. If you do see him, do yourself a favor and buy some.
<br><br>
<h3><a href="http://www.osheaslouisville.net/">O’Shea’s Irish Pub</a></h3>
O’Shea’s is a bar with an all-around fun environment. On the weekends, there is typically live entertainment in the front and a DJ and dance floor in the back. When it gets too crowded, there are so many different areas to hang out in and lots of individual bars you can get drinks at. It’s worth stopping by to grab some Irish Car Bombs.
<br><br>

<b><h2>St. Matthews Area</h2></b>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://www.tinrooflouisville.com/">Tin Roof</a></h3>
Boasting probably the biggest college crowd among all bars in Louisville, the Tin Roof is sure to create some crazy memories. With the option to hang out both inside and outside depending on the weather, this is a prime place to bring a group of friends for a night of drinking. If you’re looking for the drunkest and craziest group of people at a bar, this is the place to go. 
<br><br>
<h3><a href="http://www.gerstles.com/">Gerstle’s Place</a></h3>
Gerstle’s is another bar with a great environment for all ages (legal of course). This bar is split into three main sections: the smaller side with live entertainment connected to the outside patio, the middle area with the pool table, and the larger section with the dance floor, more live entertainment and a bigger bar. If you like to dance, this is a good place to be on the weekends. 
<br><br>

<b><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2></b>
<h3><a href="http://www.whiskeybythedrink.com/">The Silver Dollar</a></h3>
With some of the best cocktails in the city, Silver Dollar deserves some recognition. This bar also provides a great vibe and experience while delivering an incredible selection of whiskeys and other liquors. Although a bit pricey, the drinks are worth a little extra $$. If new to Louisville, I suggest the Kentucky Mule. Giving you a refreshing taste while being served over ice in a chilled copper tin, this bourbon cocktail is one of my favorites. If it is near the Kentucky Derby time of the year however, you have to at least give the Mint Julep a taste.
