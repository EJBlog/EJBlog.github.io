Since the moment Rachael and I knew we were moving to Phoenix, AZ we knew we would do be doing a lot of rock climbing. Arizona and the south western United States is known for some of the best crags in the U.S such as <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/jacks-canyon/105799277"> Jack's Canyon </a>, Mt. Lemmon, and of course Red Rock Canyon (near Las Vegas). <!--endpreview-->
</p>

<p>
Now I don't want it to seem as if we know everything there is to know about rock climbing. We most definitely don't. We have only been climbing for about three years now and the majority of it has been in the gym. We were lucky enough to live a short (two hour) drive from the climbing sactuary that is known as the Red River Gorge. So when the weather and our schedule cooperated we made the trip to Muir Valley or Miller's Fork. Still, we have only done single pitch sport climbing at a novice level. In Kentucky we were lucky enough to have great friends willing to show us the ropes (literally) and help us learn. Now that we have moved to Arizona we are looking to increase our knowledge and skills.

This past weekend Rachael, Boone, and I made our first climbing trip to Jack's Canyon. Luckily our awesome landlord is an avid climber and let us borrow her guide book. After getting lost on the two and a half hour car ride to the Winslow area, we found the gate covered with stickers. We found a random spot, set up camp and fell asleep. When we woke, it was a cool 30 degrees. By the time we finally got out of bed it was sunny and 60 degrees and we were very excited to get started.

This being our first day out climbing in Arizona, we spent our day at a warm up wall known as the Casino wall. We started with an easy few routes and topped it off with the infamous "Mickey goes to Vegas". Throughout the day we met a lot of people. We even had a neighbor's dog casually walk away with Boone's bag of food. Of those people we were lucky enough to run into three people in particular - Dan, Clay, and Connie.

Dan, Clay, and Connie had much more experience than us and were willing to help us out. All three are all avid outdoors(wo)man (climbing, mountaineering, mountain biking, fishing, you name it). They knew the area and were telling us all about other crags to go to before the Arizona summer was in full force. They even helped Rachael get through a tough spot on the last lead of the day. By the end of the day, they invited us to join them on their next weekend climbing trip at one of the many places around Phoenix. Needless to say, we are very thankful to meet them. Being new to the area we were hoping to meet some great people to help us find our way around and that exactly what we found in them.
