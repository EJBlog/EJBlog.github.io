Since the moment Rachael and I knew we were moving to Phoenix, AZ we knew we would do be doing a lot of rock climbing. Arizona and the south western United States is known for some of the best crags in the U.S such as <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/jacks-canyon/105799277"> Jack's Canyon </a>, Mt. Lemmon, and of course Red Rock Canyon (near Las Vegas). <!--endpreview-->

Now I don't want it to seem as if we know everything there is to know about rock climbing. We most definitely don't. We have only been climbing for about three years now and the majority of it has been in the gym. We were lucky enough to live a short (two hour) drive from the climbing sactuary that is known as the Red River Gorge, so when the weather and our schedule cooperated we made the trip to Muir Valley or Miller's Fork. Still, we have only done single pitch sport climbing at a novice level. In Kentucky we were lucky enough to have great friends willing to show us the ropes (literally) and help us learn. Now that we have moved to Arizona we are looking to increase our knowledge and skills.

This past weekend Rachael, Boone, and I made our first climbing trip to Jack's Canyon. Luckily our awesome landlord is an avid climber and let us borrow her guide book.
