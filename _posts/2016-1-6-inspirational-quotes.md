We all see these, so called, "inpirational quotes" all over our social media feed at any given time and yet I still find myself stopping to read. Most are in the form of Memes or pictures with perfect still shots in the background meant to motivate the reader. Some are simply the text and the authors signature line. Regardless of how they are presented, I believe there is truth in each and every one as long as the reader puts the words in the perspective of their life. Information, just like life, is all about perspective.

But why must I read each one?! <!--endpreview-->The reason is simple. I could always use a little motivation. Whether it is getting hyped to go to the gym or just getting through the work day. Motivation is like an energy drink if you do more than read the words but actually understand how that short sentence relates to your situation.
