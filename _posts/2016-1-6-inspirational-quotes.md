We all see these, so called, "inspirational quotes" all over our social media feed at any given time.. but why must I read them all?! <!--endpreview--> 
Most are in the form of Memes or pictures with perfect still shots in the background, meant to motivate the reader. Some are simply the text and the authors signature line. Regardless of how they are presented, I believe there is truth in each and every one as long as the reader puts the words in the perspective of their life. Information, just like life, is all about perspective. 
<br><br>
But why must I read each one?! The reason is simple. I could always use a little motivation. Whether it is getting hyped to go to the gym or just getting through the work day. Motivation is like an energy drink when you do more than read the words but actually understand how that short sentence relates to your situation. 
<br><br>
Here are a few of my favorite quotes and what they mean to me. Maybe they will motivate you as well!
<ol>
  <li>"Life is not tried, it is merely survived, if you're standing outside the fire" - Garth Brooks</li>
    <ul>
      <li>To me, this is a just a good old country song demonstrating that life isn't truly experienced unless you get out of your comfort zone and do something crazy every now and then.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <li>"Life begins at the end of your comfort zone" - Neale Donald Walsch</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This is similar to Garth's quote although a little more straight forward. Sometimes you just gotta go for it.</li>
      </ul>
  <br>
  <li>"I've failed over and over again, and that is why I succeed" - Michael Jordan </li>
    <ul>    
        <li>If this doesn't motivate you to push yourself than I dont know what will. Arguably the greatest basketball player of all time demonstrates that you must be persistant and have a short memory in order to progress in life.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <li>"It will not always be summer" - Hesoid </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Lastly, to me, this means you must make the most of the good times because the not-so-good times are inevitably coming.</li>
      </ul>
</ol>
