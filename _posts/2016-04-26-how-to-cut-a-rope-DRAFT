<p>Rock Climbing is inherently dangerous so making sure all of your gear is in good condition is very important. There are many easy ways to check your gear and sometimes you may find it needs replacing.<!--endpreview-->

<p>Rachael and I bought our first rope in the fall of 2015. It was a beautiful Sterling Velocity 9.8mm 60 meter rope. For those that aren't familiar with climbing ropes that means it was a Sterling Brand, Velocity model (basically the name the Sterling gave this particular rope), 9.8 millimeters in diameter, and 60 meters long. Ropes range in diameter, length, and either static or dynamic. The larger the diameter and longer the length, the stronger (and heavier) the rope. Our rope (and generally all rock climbing ropes) is a dynamic rope meaning it will stretch a little. We want a dynamic rope so when you take a fall, it lessens the impact on the climber. Static ropes may be used for things like repelling or rescues.

Unfortunately, on one of the first few days out using our new rope I decided to lead a wet and slimy 5.8 route and took a fall. The fall wasn't long or hard, but the rope was over a sharp edge of a ledge. Once I finished the climb we could see the rope's sheath (outer layer) was damaged and the fall put enough pressure on the core of the rope to where we weren't comfortable using it anymore. We determined this By squeezing the rope in various places and comparing it to the damaged area. Doing this ourselves, and asking other climber's opinions, we could tell the core was not as firm as it should be.

Like we had mentioned before, this rope was very new. We really didn't want to retire the entire rope since the damaged area was only a couple meters from one of the ends. So we decided to cut the end of the rope where it had been damaged. Luckily the local climbing gym was gracious enough to let us use their tools to cut the rope so we didnt have to go out and buy them outselves. Here is a video of the rope being cut.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm_TYDJImyI&feature=youtu.be

The video may be a little hard to see what is going on so I will explain. We are using an <a href="http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/product.do?part=117825&engine=adwordskeyword=product_ad&gclid=Cj0KEQjwo_y4BRD0nMnfoqqnxtEBEiQAWdA129gIpmjRlF8pm5ZgqD8ZuAgkfNuMilCCGF75N8gfypMaAvOO8P8HAQ">electric rope cutting gun</a> that essentially heats up a wire that will (with a little bit of force) cut through the rope and burn the ends closed while it is doing so. The reason we want to burn the ends is so there is no fraying. There are many ways to do this at home so I here is a <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/tricks-to-cutting-rope/108288215#a_108294587">forum discussion</a> for some other techniques that may not involve buying one of these cutting guns.
