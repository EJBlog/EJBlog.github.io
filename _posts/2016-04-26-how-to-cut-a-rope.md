<p>Rock Climbing is inherently dangerous so making sure all of your gear is in good condition is very important. There are many easy ways to check your gear and sometimes you may find it needs replacing.<!--endpreview-->

<p>Rachael and I bought our first rope in the fall of 2015. It was a beautiful Sterling Velocity 9.8mm 60 meter rope. For those that aren't familiar with climbing ropes that means it was a Sterling Brand, Velocity model (basically the name the Sterling gave this particular rope), 9.8 millimeters in diameter, and 60 meters long. Ropes range in brand, color, diameter, length, and either static or dynamic. The larger the diameter, the stronger (and heavier) the rope; Our rope (and generally all ropes used for lead climbing) is a dynamic rope meaning it will stretch a little. We want a dynamic rope so when you take a fall, it lessens the impact on the climber. Static ropes may be used for things like repelling or rescues.

<p>
Unfortunately, on one of the first few days out using our new rope I decided to lead a wet and slimy 5.8 sport route and took a fall. The fall wasn't long, but the rope was over a sharp edge of a ledge. Once I finished the climb we could see the rope's sheath (outer layer) was frayed and could tell that the fall put enough pressure on the core of the rope to where we weren't comfortable using it anymore. 
</p>

<p>
We could not see the core (the center of rope) sticking out through the sheath or any obvious signs of wear and tear on the core so we had to make our decision by feeling the rope. You can squeeze the damaged area of rope between your pointer finger and thumb as well as various non-damaged places of the rope and compare. You should be able to tell that the "good" portions feel firm and not very spongy, although the damaged area feels much more soft. Another good idea is folding the damaged portion of rope in half so it makes a small hole or an eye. By doing this you can tell how strong the core is. If that eye is able to close completely (meaning you can squeeze that hole and make the rope touch itself) without an extreme amount of force then the rope has been weakened. Doing this ourselves, and asking other climber's opinions, we could tell the core was not as firm as it should be. 
</p>

Like we had mentioned before, this rope was very new. We didn't want to retire the entire rope since the damaged area was only a couple meters from one of the ends. So we decided to cut the end of the rope where it had been damaged. Luckily the local climbing gym was gracious enough to let us use their tools to cut the rope so we didn't have to go out and buy them ourselves. Here is a video of the rope being cut:

The video may be a little hard to see what is going on so I will explain. We are using an <a href="http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/product.do?part=117825&engine=adwordskeyword=product_ad&gclid=Cj0KEQjwo_y4BRD0nMnfoqqnxtEBEiQAWdA129gIpmjRlF8pm5ZgqD8ZuAgkfNuMilCCGF75N8gfypMaAvOO8P8HAQ">electric rope cutting gun</a> that essentially heats up a wire that will (with a little bit of force) cut through the rope and burn the ends closed while it is doing so. The reason we want to burn the ends is so there is no fraying or loose ends. There are many ways to do this at home so here is a <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/tricks-to-cutting-rope/108288215#a_108294587">forum discussion</a> for some other techniques that may not involve buying one of these cutting guns.

Cutting your rope seems easy and can save you a lot of money, although it is not always the solution. There will be a time when a rope needs to be retired for good. When it comes to rock climbing, I believe, it is always a good idea to err on the side of caution because saving a few dollars is not worth risking your life. Be sure to protect your climbing rope by using a rope bag and tarp to protect it from being over exposed to the sun and dirt. Also make sure to clean your rope properly if it begins to get too dirty. I dirty rope may affect your belay devices and other pieces of gear without you even realizing it.
