Build a life you don’t need a vacation from...

I have always been a sucker for the life-hacking culture. It doesn't matter what you’re doing, there are always ways to incrementally improve. This mindset led me down the engineering career path. I received a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Louisville and The Ville has been my home ever since.

Along the way I have diagnosed myself with ADD - Adventure Deficit Disorder. As corny as it sounds, I cannot put my life on hold from 9 to 5 - Monday to Friday waiting for the weekend or measly PTO day. So I keep myself busy by creating a life with freedom and planning trip after trip. I like to travel, camp, hike, fish, ski, mountain bike, shoot guns, cliff jump, stay fit, enjoy bourbon, and everything in-between. I am a passionate Chicago sports fan (Cubs not Sox), tech enthusiast, and I’m always on the lookout for my next rush. I have a beautiful girlfriend, Kate, that keeps me level and feeds my addiction to traveling. I’m always up to something.
