I live for experiences rather than possessions. Meeting new people, trying new foods, seeing new things, is what gets me going. I love the outdoors, reading, sports, exercise. My faith in Christ makes everything in life worth it. I am an easy-going, fun-loving, joke-telling Louisvillian. I have Dad humor and I use the word “goober” way too much. The Dab was created by Superman(Cam Newton). “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself” -FDR. GO TAKE A RISK. You will be glad you did.
