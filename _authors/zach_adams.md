Class of 2015 University of Louisville graduate with a BA in English and currently working on my Masters at Western Kentucky University in English.

As a lover of the English language and stories I enjoy writing and working with texts that have helped shape and form the world in which we live. I believe that novels cannot only teach us more about the world, but can open us up to who we are and help us realize why we think the way the we do. Each story is an adventure and each adventure is right outside your door.

In my free time I enjoy writing songs and playing music for people. You can catch me in Nashville on any given day of the week singing songs from the heart for anyone to hear and relate to. Also, I enjoy writing poems and have been published in a few small, independent literary magazines. Others things I enjoy are being outdoors, hiking, spending time with friends, and attending concerts where I can let loose and get in touch with my inner hippie.
