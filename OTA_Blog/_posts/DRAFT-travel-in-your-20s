<p>Travel before you have kids and a family and start to grow root (figuratively and literally</p>

<p>
Travel to find what you are searching for or to find that you aren't searching for everything. Travel to find out who you are or who you want to be. Travel because we are being told each day that the earth is dying just like we are. Travel because you can. Travel because meeting people in different areas can create the most real and genuine connection than those people you met in a classroom or in a forced situation. Travel because humans are explorers and if our ancestors did not travel then we may not be here today. Travel to find those people that really want to keep in touch and not just say it. Travel for food. Travel for adventure. Travel for the views.
