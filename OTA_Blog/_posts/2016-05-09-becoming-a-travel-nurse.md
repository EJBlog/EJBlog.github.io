Ever since I was a little girl, I always knew I wanted to go into nursing. I guess it

helped that my mom is also a nurse. During my senior year of high school, I was

apart of a program that allowed seniors to shadow different professions for half of

the day. I took full advantage of this program which confirmed my preexisting

thoughts that nursing was the chosen path for me. With nursing, there are endless

opportunities, which I don’t think I fully grasped until I was in college.<!--endpreview-->
</p>

<p>
During the spring semester of my senior year in college and graduation right around

the corner, I really started to think about my future and career in nursing. Did I want

to work with newborns, pediatrics, or adults? Did I want to be in a specialized unit

(cardiac, neuroscience, etc.)? Intensive care unit or step down unit? Most

importantly, where do I see myself in five years?
</p>

<p>

Well, I knew I always had the idea of travel nursing. So for me, experience was the

key! So, I wanted to decide which age group I wanted to work with and what area I

loved. That way, I could get experience and not have to be switching jobs or areas 6

months or a year into my nursing career.
</p>

<p>

With more shadowing, I decided I loved the intensive care units (ICU). With the

process of elimination, I made the decision working with adults would fit me best. I

also realized I would be very marketable working with adults in the ICU because

there are always needs and jobs available.
</p>

<p>

When applying for jobs as a new graduate, I kept remembering what every

experienced nurse told me - if you have one year of critical care experience, you can

work anywhere. Since I knew I wanted to be in the ICU and had the thought of

potentially doing travel nursing, I wanted to start right away in the ICU as a new

graduate. Usually, getting a job in the ICU as a new graduate is unheard of, but I

knew this was the area I loved and wanted to be in. I didn’t want to have to get a

year or two of experience in a step down unit and then transfer into the ICU.
</p>

<p>

With the networking I had built from working in the hospital during nursing school,

I was able to start in the Neuroscience ICU at the University of Louisville Hospital

(ULH) as a new graduate. As nervous as I was to start in the ICU as a new graduate, I

was even more excited because I knew I was in the profession AND area I loved and

was passionate about. Passion will take you a long way in life, to make you feel like

everything is worthwhile and feel less like a job. I also knew, ULH had the type of

patient population I liked to care for as well as being a level 1 trauma center, I mean

how much better can it get?!
</p>

<p>

A year a half into my nursing career, I am content and comfortable with where I am

in life. I start questioning what I want to do in life. My coworkers and friends from

nursing school are already going back to school. So, what do I want to do? I know I

want to travel and that I love to travel, but that’s hard to do and get approved time

off from work. Jake and I have traveled a lot in Kentucky and outside of Kentucky,

but we wanted to do more. With my lease ending soon and travel nursing at the

forefront of my thoughts, I remember a quote I read, “Life begins at the end of your

comfort zone.”
</p>

<p>

Because of all of the universal signs God was showing me, I decided to start

investigating travel nursing companies. I was applying to a travel nursing company

and before I knew it, I had interviews and accepted my first travel nursing

assignment in Phoenix, Arizona.
</p>

<p>

With over half way through my first contract, I can already tell you travel nursing is

by far the best decision I have ever made. It is perfect for me for simply one reason, I

love to travel. I love to embrace new cultures and areas. I embrace change and new

beginnings. While being comfortable and content is a nice feeling to have, I know it

was never meant for me. I know putting myself outside of my comfort zone is how I

become the best version of myself (and nurse). You learn a lot about yourself and it

keeps you on your toes. I fully believe you have one life to live, and I don’t intend on

wasting it. So I want to take control of my life and take risks, explore, and see as

much as I can! The best part about this experience is that I get to have my amazing

boyfriend, Jake, and dog, Boonie, with me every step of the way through every single

adventure. I couldn’t be more thankful for that!
</p>

<p>

Special thanks:

I have the University of Louisville Hospital to thank for the nurse I am today, which

obviously includes all the amazing nurses and doctors who have turned into my

family. ULH will always be my home and I can’t thank all of my mentors and

coworkers enough for all the love, support, and guidance through my nursing

career.
