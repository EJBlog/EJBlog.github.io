Nurse by night, adventurer by day. I’m Rachael Chlebowy. I graduated from the wonderful University of Louisville with my Bachelors of Science in Nursing. I am an ICU nurse. As of 2 months ago, I am a currently working as a travel nurse! This allows me to do everything I love to do- learn, push myself to be the best person I can be (personally and career wise), put myself out of my comfort zone, and most importantly TRAVEL. I have my boyfriend, Jake, and our pup to thank for the never-ending love and support whom keep me grounded and on the straight and narrow path. (PS you should recognize Jake’s name because he is the founder of this blog ha)
