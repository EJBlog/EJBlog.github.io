https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/raphael/intro/ - SVG versus Canvas. SVG seems better.

Requirements:
Upload pictures onto the site
Edit, Crop, filter images on our site
Fit images to the shape of state(s) of the user's choice
Allow users to choose from preexisting maps or load their own
Export Individual state images or entire country projects
Save states and/or country projects

Short term goals:
Get editor/canvas to change size and shape to specific states
  -- We are having issues with Clippath not working so here are other possible (untried) solutions
        - save the state image into PNG and reload it some how?
        - Create images for each state in photoshop where the inside/background of the state is empty
        - Embedding/nesting canvases?
Add CSS and make the pages look good


xBe able to click on a state and move to the editor page for that particular state - DONE
xBe able to resize and move an image to fit inside the state size and shape - DONE
xBe able to load an image from our local drive - DONE
xBe able to save a finished Kentucky state image - DONEish

Medium term goals (After MVP is finished):
Maybe change the site so the editor isnt a separate page but is just a pop up
Build log-in page
build in storage for people to work on a map, save, and come back later to work on it.
If the user has an account and is logged in then allow user to edit and save their image and then that state should show up GREEN on the large map to show they have completed that state
Alternative to having storage and a log-in --> Maybe we could have the user save a file to their own computer when they are finished and when they want to start again they can reload that file to our site

Long term goals:
Allow user to edit and save their image into the shape of a state and then that image should show up on the large map if they have an account and are logged in
Start printing/ cutting states or images into wood
Maybe work with small business for printing - we create the map of images and partner with Etsy or small businesses for printing
User can upload any image and we will use the outline of that image to fit a picture of the user's choice into it.
