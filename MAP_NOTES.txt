https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/raphael/intro/ - SVG versus Canvas. SVG seems better.

Requirements:
Upload pictures onto the site
Edit, Crop, filter images on our site
Fit images to the shape of state(s) of the user's choice
Allow users to choose from preexisting maps or load their own
Export Individual state images or entire country projects
Save states and/or country projects

Short term goals:
for mobile: the map wont fit so use a drop down list for the map page
Integrate the map and editor into the OTA website.

Update CSS - Jake
Evan - Explore having a button that will bring the user's image to the front (so you can see the entire image) instead of just seeing what is inside the state.
Feedback page - link to survey monkey instead of just email.

Possibly add in a button to allow user to adjust size of state outline
Update pop up for when loading multiple images?
Update reset button/link - be able to remove selected items or just reset everything


xGet editor/canvas to change size and shape to specific states --> Evan was able to set the overlay state as the canvas. Changing the editor and canvas div on the html page made this work.- DONE
xAdd radio buttons to change the color of the state outline
xAdd CSS and make the pages look good - DONE
xAdd a feedback page/ link for MVP testing - DONE
xChange or remove the confirm dialog box when the user clicks a state on the first map page. - DONE
xBe able to click on a state and move to the editor page for that particular state - DONE
xBe able to resize and move an image to fit inside the state size and shape - DONE
xBe able to load an image from our local drive - DONE
xBe able to save a finished Kentucky state image - DONEish

Medium term goals (After MVP is finished):
Be able to change the size of the state to match different map sizes
Create this functionality for multiple continents/countries
Drag and Drop image uploading
Maybe change the site so the editor isnt a separate page but is just a pop up
Build log-in page
build in storage for people to work on a map, save, and come back later to work on it.
If the user has an account and is logged in then allow user to edit and save their image and then that state should show up GREEN on the large map to show they have completed that state
Alternative to having storage and a log-in --> Maybe we could have the user save a file to their own computer when they are finished and when they want to start again they can reload that file to our site

Long term goals:
Allow user to edit and save their image into the shape of a state and then that image should show up on the large map if they have an account and are logged in
Start printing/ cutting states or images into wood
Maybe work with small business for printing - we create the map of images and partner with Etsy or small businesses for printing
User can upload any image and we will use the outline of that image to fit a picture of the user's choice into it.
